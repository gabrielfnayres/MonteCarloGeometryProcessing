# Monte-Carlo Geometry Processes for Solving PDEs

This repository showcases the differences between two Monte-Carlo geometry processes used to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), with applications in generating 2D and 3D images.

## ðŸ“– Overview

Monte-Carlo methods are widely used for solving complex PDEs due to their probabilistic approach and scalability to high-dimensional problems. This repository compares two distinct Monte-Carlo geometry techniques, highlighting their effectiveness, accuracy, and performance in 2D and 3D image generation tasks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Demonstrate the capabilities of each Monte-Carlo geometry process.
- Analyze their differences in terms of computational efficiency and results.
- Provide visual examples of 2D and 3D images generated using each method.
